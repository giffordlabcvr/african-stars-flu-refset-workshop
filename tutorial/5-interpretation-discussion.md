# 5: Interpretation & discussion (10 min)

-   Did the curated set avoid dominance by one month/outbreak?
-   What changed when grouping by `year` vs `year+month`?
-   Would grouping by **province** help if metadata were complete?
-   What are the risks of **over-curation** (dropping real diversity)?
-   How would you adapt rules for **H1N1**, **IBV**, or a **different country**?
